We recommend installing using Ubuntu 24.04 with python 3.13 (see `pyproject.toml` for the supported range).

Required packages are listed in the ```settings.json``` file, for now the packages must be installed manually.

```bash 
gws brick install-deps [PATH_TO_SETTINGS.JSON]
```

#### Usage


▶️ To start the server :

```bash
gws server run
```

🕵️ To run a given unit test

```bash
gws server test [TEST_FILE_NAME]
```

Replace `[TEST_FILE_NAME]` with the name of the test file (without `.py`) in the tests folder. Execute this command in the folder of the brick.

🕵️ To run the whole test suite, use the following command:

```bash
gws server test all
```

📌 VSCode users can use the predefined run configuration in `.vscode/launch.json`.
